In this MERN stack blog application, users can register, log in, and create articles with ease. The application incorporates key features such as user authentication, CRUD operations, RESTful API communication, and robust error handling. The project serves as a practical demonstration of my skills in web development using the MERN stack. 

**Technologies Used:** 
- **Stack:** MERN (MongoDB, Express, React.js & Node.js)
- **Dependencies:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT), Multer (for file processing), CKEditor (editor for blogs), RESTful API, Middleware in Express.js (body-parser, json-parser, cookieparser), Fetch API

**Achievements:** 
- **Implemented Secure User Authentication:** Utilized Bcrypt for password hashing and JWT web tokens for secure user authentication, ensuring protected user sessions with cookies/tokens. 
- **Enabled CRUD Operations:** Users can seamlessly create accounts, manage blog content, and perform CRUD operations using intuitive backend panels. 
- **Established RESTful API Communication:** Ensured seamless data exchange between the frontend and backend through RESTful API communication. 
- **Contextual User Management:** Employed React's useContext hook to create a userContext, enabling efficient user state management across the client-side application. 
- **State Management with React:** Implemented React Hooks for efficient state management, enabling features such as loading effects, error message display, and user login state checks. 
- **Blog Publishing System:** Developed a user-friendly blog publishing system for registered users. Users can input and submit article details including title, summary, featured image, and content body for publication. 
- **Rich Text Editing:** Integrated CKEditor as the primary text editor, providing users with a powerful and intuitive interface for content creation. 
- **File Processing:** Enabled file uploads, particularly for featured images, utilizing the multer package to handle multipart/form-data requests effectively. 
- **React and Server Routing:** Implemented React routing for client-side navigation and server routing for handling requests on the backend.
